## Description

The Rendlesham Forest Incident is Britain's most famous UFO event, often called "Britain's Roswell." Over several nights in late December 1980, U.S. Air Force personnel stationed at the twin NATO bases of RAF Woodbridge and RAF Bentwaters reported seeing unexplained lights and a craft in nearby Rendlesham Forest. The incident involved multiple military witnesses, physical trace evidence, radiation readings, and official documentation, making it one of the best-documented UFO cases involving military personnel.

The primary witness, Lieutenant Colonel Charles Halt (Deputy Base Commander), filed an official memo to the UK Ministry of Defence detailing the events. Personnel reported seeing a triangular metallic craft with colored lights hovering and moving through the forest. Some witnesses claimed to observe strange symbols on the object's surface. The forest floor showed indentations and burn marks where the craft allegedly landed, and radiation levels above normal were recorded.

What makes Rendlesham exceptional is the quality of witnesses (trained military observers), physical evidence (ground traces, radiation), official documentation (Halt Memo), and the fact that it occurred on NATO bases during the Cold War. Despite official British dismissal and U.S. downplaying, many witnesses maintain their accounts, and the case remains central to UFO research and debate about military encounters with unknown phenomena.
